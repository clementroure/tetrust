## 20220915 - Basis of game engine and rendering

* Try to separate the game logic and the render engine
* Render the matrix with a 10x20 grid
* Render each tetrimino accurately, including the color
* make current active tetrimino fall every second until it touches the bottom of the screen

## 20220908 - Init

* Skim over the specification in docs, try to figure out what we should do first.
* Add piston lib to our dependencies, import it in `main.rs`
* Create a new display with piston library, with title "Tetrust" and resolution 640x480
